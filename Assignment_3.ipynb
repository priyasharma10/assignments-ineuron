    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans: There is one global scope. And whenever any function is defined , it creates a local scope.\n",

    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans:They are destroyed\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans: Return value basically returns the output after the function did its operation or whatever is defined as return value. \n",
    "Yes we can use a return value in an expression as it has it's defined type.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans: NoneType\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans: If we define a variable outside function scope, it will be global variable. \n",
    "    We've it just call it, it will refer to global variable\n",

    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans: Try clause is used to deal with any possible error that our program can encounter.It has code written in it for same.\n",
    "    Except block has code, which will be executed if an error according to try block is occured.\n"
