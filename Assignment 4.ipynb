    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Ans: [] is a blank list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "Ans : spam[2]=’hello’\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "Ans: ‘d’\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "Ans: ‘d’\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\n",
    "Ans: ['a', 'b']\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Ans: 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "Ans: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Ans: [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Ans : list concatenation done using : +\n",
    "          List replication done using : *\n",
    "                \n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "Ans: append() insert/add/concate value at the end of list. Insert() add at the particular index we passed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans: pop(), remove()\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Ans: Both list and string values can be accessed using index.\n",
    "    \n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans: tuples are immutable , lists are mutable. Tuple have only two functions – index() & count(), list have so many functions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans: t = (42,)\n",
    "    \n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "List to tuple: \n",
    "l = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "t = tuple(l)\n",
    "tuple to list:\n",
    "t1 = (1,6,7,8)\n",
    "l1 = list(t1)\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Ans: They contain multiple items also called elements, which can be of any data type.\n",
    "    \n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Ans: copy. copy() returns a shallow copy of list which means that any change in copy with reflect in original list and copy.deepcopy() return a deep copy of list, means any changes made in copy of object doesn’t reflect in original list.\n"
